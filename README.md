# Stack-augmented Parser-Interpreter Neural Network

This repository contains the source code based on the paper [A Fast Unified Model for Sentence Parsing and Understanding][1] and [original codebase][9]. For a more informal introduction to the ideas behind the model, see this [Stanford NLP blog post][8].


The included implementations are:

- A **Python/Pytorch** implementation of SPINN using a na√Øve stack representation (named `fat-stack`)

## Python code

The Python code lives, quite intuitively, in the `python` folder. We used this code to train and test the SPINN models before publication.

### Installation

Requirements:

- Python 2.7
- Pytorch

Install most required Python dependencies using the command below.

    pip install -r python/requirements.txt

Install Pytorch based on instructions online: http://pytorch.org

### Running the code

The main executable for the SNLI experiments in the paper is [fat_classifier.py](https://github.com/mrdrozdov/spinn/blob/master/python/spinn/models/fat_classifier.py), whose flags specify the hyperparameters of the model. You can specify the gpu id using the `--gpu <gpu_id>` flag. Uses the CPU by default.

Here's a sample command that runs a fast, low-dimensional CPU training run, training and testing only on the dev set. It assumes that you have a copy of [SNLI](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/) available locally.

    PYTHONPATH=spinn/python \
        python2.7 -m spinn.models.fat_classifier --data_type snli \
        --training_data_path spinn/snli_1.0/snli_1.0_dev.jsonl \
        --eval_data_path spinn/snli_1.0/snli_1.0_dev.jsonl \
        --embedding_data_path spinn/python/spinn/tests/test_embedding_matrix.5d.txt \
        --word_embedding_dim 10 --model_dim 10 --model_type CBOW

For full runs, you'll also need a copy of the 840B word 300D [GloVe word vectors](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).

### Viewing Summaries in Tensorboard

Metrics are logged periodically with Tensorboard Logger to a directory specified by `--metrics_path`. You will need to install Tensorflow in order to use Tensorboard, but it is an optional dependency for this project.
